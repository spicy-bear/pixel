This project is a web-based pixel art converter that lets you transform images into pixelated art with a variety of retro palettes and effects.  
You can adjust brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, dithering, pixel size, and apply special effects like CRT scanlines, glow, and curvature.  
Choose from many color palettes inspired by classic hardware and modern aesthetics.

Since this is all done in the browser it can definitely get a little sluggish.
